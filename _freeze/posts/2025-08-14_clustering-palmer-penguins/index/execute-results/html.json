It's easy to run a script file from a blogpost using a code chunk that looks like this:\n\n```{{python}}\n# | include: false\n%run penguins-clustering.py\n```\n\n\n## Analysis\n\nThis script performs a K-Means clustering on the palmer penguins dataset.\n\nOut of 333 penguins, our model misclassified 5.0% of the penguins.\n\nThe model has these parameters:\n\n- Number of Clusters: 3\n\n- Max Iterations: 300\n\nThis plotnine chart exposes where penguins were misclassified:\n\n\n\n![](scatter-clustering.png){width=\"6in\" height=\"4in\"}\n\n",
