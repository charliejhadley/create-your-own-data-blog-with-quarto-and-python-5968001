Shiny is an incredibly framework for [building interactive dashboards, web apps and more **directly** from Python](https://shiny.posit.co/py/gallery/).

Fishing minigames in Stardew Valley and similar games are really interesting to me. I have a side project exploring how different mathematical functions are used to create "bouncy" or "squelchy" bumps in the animations. There's not much to share yet...
